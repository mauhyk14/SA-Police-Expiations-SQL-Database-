# SA-Police-Expiations-SQL-Database-
Database Fundamentals Assignment 2
Instructions:
1.	Download the Expiation database from the Assignments tab of the course website and attach it to your SQL Server (as per practicals)

2.	There is no UML diagram of the database as the data is presented in an un-normalized form in a single table.  You will need to look through the column titles and some of the data to determine the significance of each column in the table.  You can also visit the Data SA website for further detail about the data sets: https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/expiation-notice-system-data  

3.	You are not allowed to use Views, Stored Procedures or any SQL that contains Data Definition Language (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ENABLE, DISABLE etcâ€¦).  These are deactivated on the test SQL Server.  Sorry!

4.	Use the expiation database to write queries to answer the questions below and paste your final SQL query into the corresponding .SQL file along with your username.  It is recommended that you write your queries to run as efficiently as possible.  Slow queries will cost marks!  If required, include any assumptions you make about the data as a comment in your .SQL file.  It is recommended you try to answer each question using at least two different approaches to double check you are happy with your result output.  Then choose the fastest query as your final answer.  Once you have completed all your files, upload them to the learn-online assignment submission area.

Questions
Note: The example outputs do not indicate the number of rows or the exact values you should expect to see from your answers.  They are indicative of the layout only.  It is up to you to test your responses using the different query approaches discussed throughout the semester and use this to decide if you have written a query correctly!

-- Example output:
-- actualTickets	withDrawnTickets
--  100,000,000		200,333


--Q1007 Find the number of known expiations in 2018 for each of the different registration states recorded in the database.  Order the results from highest to lowest expiation count.
-- Example output:
-- regStateDescExpiationVehicle	expiationCount
SOUTH AUSTRALIA		    266,818


--Q1008 Write a query to compare the number of speeding tickets issued for the 3 months leading up to the 2018 March state election (Jan-March inclusive) vs the same tickets issued in the 3 months post election (Apr-Jun inclusive)
-- Example output
offenceCode	offenceDescription					preElecCount	postElecCount
A771	EXCEED DEFAULT SPEED IN BUILT UP AREA BY 10-19 KPH	322		314

-- example output:
-- ticketCount2017	TicketCount2018
57			20


Bonus Questions
